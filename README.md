## Hi! I'm Tuukka 👋
**An information technology student at HAAGA-HELIA UAS, focusing on software development.**

<br>

- 👨‍💻 I'm independent, but not afraid to learn from others or ask for help.

- 💻 I thoroughly enjoy all about computers, software and tech.

- 🎮 On my freetime you can find me ricing my linux installs, programming, playing and making games.
  
- 📚 Currently learning C++, SFML and React Native.

- 🎙 What's the difference between a bass player and a hardwood floor? <em>The floor can support a family.</em>

- 🎻 I also play the bass.
